# Understanding a Linux based OS:  S1E2 - Filesystem

When you open a terminal, usually, you land up is your home `/home/<your name>`

## Navigating through the filesystem
- `pwd` - Print Working directory

- `cd` - Change directory

- `ls` - List the contents of directory
    
 Option | Meaning 
---------|----------
`-a` | Shows hidden files (The ones whose name begins with `.`)
`-i` | Show `inode` number
`-l` | Long List
`-h` | Human Readable file sizes

- `file` - Identifies the type of file

- `cp` and `mv` - Copy and move, respectively

## Special Directories
- `.` - The current directory
- `..` - The previous directory
- `/` - Root
- `~` - *Your* home

## Tree structure of the file system

    /
    ├── bin
    ├── boot
    ├── dev
    ├── etc
    ├── home
    ├── lib
    ├── proc
    ├── sys
    ├── tmp
    .
    .

Directory | Purpose
----------|--------
`/bin` | Binary files to be used by all users
`/boot` | Bootloader files
`/dev` | Device files
`/etc` | Configuration files
`/home` | home of users
`/lib` | Static and dynamic libraries
`/proc` | `procfs`- Process file system
`/sys` | `sysfs` - The filesystem exported by the kernel to control hardware
`/tmp` | `tempfs` - Temporary files go here
----
### The [`procfs`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Procfs)
- Virtual file system
- On-demand file access (so all file sizes are 0)
- Can be used to interact with the kernel (you can use system calls also)
- Provides information related to the system as a whole, and of individual processes
- Following is a list of some files providing information related to system

File | Description
-----|------------
[`/proc/uptime`](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/deployment_guide/s2-proc-uptime) | System uptime in seconds.
`/proc/cpuinfo` | CPU Information (Can also get using `lscpu`)
`/proc/meminfo`| Memory information
`/proc/vmstat` | Virtual memory information
`/proc/mounts` | Information on mounted file systems (Can also get it using `mount` command)
`/proc/filesystems` | Supported file systems
`/proc/self/fd/0` | `stdin` - The standard input stream
`/proc/self/fd/1` | `stdout` - The standard output stream
`/proc/self/fd/2` | `stderr` - The standard error stream
- Following is a list of some files provinding information related to each process. They reside in `/proc/<pid>`

File | Description
-----|------------
`cmdline`| Command line used to start the process
`comm` | The process name in the command line
`cwd` | Link to the directory in which the process has started
`exe` | Link to the program executable
`environ` | Environment variables inside the process
`limits` | Resource limits for the current process
`maps` | Memory map of the process
`status` | Status of the process
------
### The `sysfs`
- Also a virtual file system
- `kobject` hierarchy exported by the kernel
- Used to activate/deactivate kernel features (without coding)
- If a file has write flag enabled, it can be used to do configuration
- We can play with `/sys/class/leds/<device>/brightness` value to turn LEDs of the device on and off by just using `echo`.
----
### `/dev` - The Devices
- The real and pseudo devices that are attached to the system
- 2 types - block (`b`) and character (`c`)
- Out of pseudo devices, terminal devices `/dev/tty*` and `/dev/pts/*` can be used to communicate with other real terminals and terminal emulator sessions, respectively
- `/dev/zero`, `/dev/null` act as an infinite supply of zeros, and, infinite sink, respectively
- `/dev/random` is the random number generator provided bt the kernel
- `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` provide the streams to process to read and write the data.
- Other files corresponding to real devices have drivers implemented for them. According to the driver specifications, we can communicate with them
----
### `/tmp` - The `tempfs`
- Temporary filesystem, as the name implies!
- Files on a volatile memory
- Fast access, but not too much files
- Storing intermediate data
----
### `/etc` - Home of configuration files
- Many configuration files are stored here, organized by application
- The configuration is a plain text that is read by the application
- Some important files are listed below

File | Description
-----|------------
`passwd` | List of users
`shadow` | Hashed passwords!
`fstab` | Default mounts file
`hosts` | Host definition for local system <!--show host redirection-->
`hostname` | Current hostname
`resolv.conf` | DNS server configuration
----
### `/home` - Your home
- `~`
- Your files are stored here, under your ownership
- Per-user configurations and data are stored in `~/.local`
- But, home of the root is `/home/root`, but `/root`
---------
## Links
Many times, we become lazy to walk the file system tree, so shortcuts are needed. They are called links in Linux.

There are 2 types of links in Linux.
1. Soft links
2. Hard links

### Soft Links

    ----------        ---------
    |  file1 |<---    | link  |
    ----------   |    ---------
        |        |       |
        V        |       V
    ----------   |     ---------
    | Inode1 |   ---- |Inode2 |
    ---------         ---------

    ln -s file1 link

### Hard Links
                             ---------
    ----------        -------| file1 |
    | Inode1 |<-------|      ---------
    --------          |      ---------
                      -------| link  |
                             ---------

    ln file1 link

- Impossible to hard link directories
- `rm` is not deleting the files, but unlinking them.
- Due to the above reason, if we delete `file1`, we can still access its content using `link`.
--------------------
## Attaching External Filesystems
Linux allows you to attach an external filesystem to a point in the existing file system tree. This process is called *mounting*

The point at which external filesystem gets attached is called *mount point*

Use `mount` to list currently mounted filesystems.

`mount <disk path> <mountpoint>` to mount an external file systems

`umount <dispath or mountpoint>` is used to unmount the file system

            Before mount
    =============================
    Host System
    --------------   
    /
    ├── ...
    ├── ...
    ├── volume1
    ├── ...
    ├── ...
    .
    .

    Extenral Filesystem at /dev/disk1s2
    -----------------------------------
    /
    ├── dir1
    ├── dir2
    ├── dir3
    ├── ...
    .
    .

    After `mount /dev/disk1s2 volume1`
    ===================================
    /
    ├── ...
    ├── ...
    ├── volume1
    │   ├── dir1
    │   ├── dir2
    │   ├── dir3
    │   ├── ...
    |   .
    |   .
    ├── ...
    .
    .

### Switching root - `chroot`
- If the mounted directory is a Linux root, you can get the shell of mounted Linux using `chroot <mountpoint>`.
- But you need to link `/dev` and `/proc` of the host (either using `ln -s` or `mount -o bind`) to that of the inside of the mount point.
- If we want network access inside the shell, we also have to copy `/etc/resolv.conf` to the inside of the mount point. 
- This process is typically done from live-boot media to gain access to OS on a hard disk to repair it.

### Unsupported Filesystems
- `mount` supports filesystems implemented in the kernel
- To add new filesystem, we have to implement a kernel module
- But, **FUSE** (**F**ile system in **USE**r space) allows us to implement file system in userspace
- Just have to implement a bunch of functions!
- Your classmates are working on a project on FUSE :smile:
- `exfat-fuse`, `apfs-fuse`, ...

## Filesystem Utilities
Linux has several utilities to work with filesystem. They are listed below

Utility | Uses 
--------|------
`mount` and `umount` | Mounting and unmounting a filesystem, respectively
`df` | List amount of disk space available on file system
`du` | Disk usage of each file in particular directory. `-h` to human readble sizes
`fdisk` | Partition table manipulation
