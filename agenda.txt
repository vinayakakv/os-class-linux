Agenda for OS session
-------------------------
1. Exploring linux filesystem -- /, /proc, /dev, /sys, ...
2. Shell internals -- Environment variables, shell variables, rc files
3. Compilation process -- Converting source to object file, Linking, Execution. Tracing system calls (strace)
4. Debugging C programs -- gdb and valgrind

Details
----------------
Motivation -- 
    1. Where GUI is useful and where it is not. 
        Exploring files, working with documents, photos etc
        But automatation is hard in GUI, we want some scripting Environment
        Example, want *xmp files to be moved to seperate directory
        Do a repeated photo editing task
        Scraping tasks
    2. The open source model
        Failures of windows, cite some articles
        Security in windows vs linux, reasons
    3. Opportunities
        Better understanding of computer systems and logic in general
        Sysadmin tasks
        Exposure to new programming pradigm

Walking the filesystem
    1. Basic commands 
        pwd
        ls with options
        file
        cp
        mv
        cd - meaning of . and ..
    2. File system structure
        tree structure based on /
        exploring some special directories under /
        mounting external filesyems
        mount and umount
        mount -- list supported file systems
        chroot, if possible, demo
        fuse with demo
    3. Links
        inode number
        soft and hard Links
        ln command
        ls -z option

Shell internals
    1. Understanding command Execution
        $PATH
        binaries vs shell builtins
        various shells -- sh, bash, zsh etc
    2. Shell variables
        setting
        listing
        some popular shell variables: $SHELL, $PWD etc..
    3. Aliasing commands
        application
        alias command
        listing
        setting and deleting
    4. Shell scripts and rc files
        Shebang line
        Interpreted nature of shell scripts
        chmod, chown, chgrp
        Special variables $$ $_ ...
        uses of rc files, and some of them
        .bashrc changing to set $PATH
        possibility of rc files: oh-my-zsh

Life of Code
    1. General code flow
        editors -- nano, vi, gedit, subl etc...
        language -- for now 'C'
        compiler
    2. Working of compiler
        Overview with diagram
        For more, refer ACD course and TA!
    3. gcc process 
        gcc preprocessing
        command extension
        -e preprocessing
        -s without Linking
        ld for Linking
        -g for debugging info
        objdump for disassembly

Monitoring the executable
    1. Tracing system calls
        strace
        uses and examples
    2. Debugging
        gdb 
    3. Memory checks
        valgrind
